# Monte-carlos-simulation
This code is about a 2 step decay chain which after giving the necessary inputs gives use the graph of number of undecayed nucleus VS time of all 3 nucleus formed.


This code shows how the number of atoms of the initially kept unstable compound decay in an exponential manner, the intermediate unstable atoms nucleus first increase then decrease in an exponential manner and the last stable atoms nucleus acummulate in an exponential manner.
If want to see a clear graph put lambda_1 = 0.7, lamda_2 = 0.5 and N_O = 1000
